**HandReceipt: Modernizing Supply Chain Management**

HandReceipt is a blockchain-powered inventory and supply chain management solution that streamlines property tracking and transfers.

**Military Application:**
HandReceipt digitizes the currently paper-based process of equipment transfers between military personnel. Using scannable QR codes linked to blockchain-secured digital records, we make property accountability simple, reliable, and auditable. Seeks to implement best practices and advantages enabled by private sector systems like SAP, NetSuite, Oracle, and Microsoft Dynamics.

**Commercial Application:** 
For businesses, HandReceipt offers a more affordable and user-friendly alternative to complex enterprise systems like SAP, NetSuite, Oracle, and Microsoft Dynamics. Our solution maintains accurate inventory records while enabling rapid payment processing through USDC stablecoin integration—allowing for immediate settlement when goods are received and verified.
- Commercial users can also integrate with existing systems rather than requiring entirely new hardware or processes, including integrating standard enterprise software APIs (ERP, WMS, inventory management)
- Commercial users can also employ existing scanning infrastructure (barcodes, RFID) rather than QR codes
- Commercial users also have ability to create smart contracts outlining payment terms between counterparties in supply chain 
    - Use of either traditional wire or HandReceipt’s own native coin called “Shells” (SHL)
    - Smart contracts completely customizable (can trigger payments based on receipt of goods, sales levels, inventory levels, etc)

**Key Benefits:**
- Secure digital property records that can't be altered
- Simple QR-code scanning for transfers and verification (user uses mobile app to scan a QR code on property or inventory to initiate a transfer request, counterparty who currently in possession of (or is assigned) that piece of property receives notification of transfer request which they can either accept or decline)
- Reduced paperwork and manual processes
- Transparent tracking throughout the supply chain
- Optional fast payment settlement for commercial users
